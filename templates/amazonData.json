This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using Samsung S10 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet \"A\", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customization is really good and you can customize a lot of things."}, {"user": "Kindle RJ", "title": "Genuine iPhone", "star_rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in India on 29 October 2023", "message": "I have seen that many Amazon users have been skeptical about purchasing iPhone from Darshita ezone or Darshita electronics. After I ordered the product red iPhone 13 from Darshita ezone, because of these negative reviews, even I got scared. However, I didn't cancel my order and decided to wait. Though Amazon delivered the order little late than I expected, I have received a genuine iPhone 13 product red. I checked the model number and IMEI number. All are perfect. Have been using the phone for almost 3 weeks now. Even updated to iOS 17. It's a gem. No issues. No problem. Heating is understandable during charging. But that's already expected.

For that, check the following1. If the screen has \u201cTrue Tone\u201d option.2. Check the Serial Number for \u201cM\u201d letter, indicates its new unit.3. Check if IMEI number of the product is same as mentioned on the box.4. Battery Health should be 100%.Pros:1. Camera is one of the best I have used so far.2. Haptic feedback is very great. I noticed it instantly.3. Battery optimisation is very good. It\u2019s been more than a month and I have never charged it more than 85%. Still I get a days battery easily.4. OS. I have used Android before this. And change in OS was good change as well.Cons:Charge speed is slow. I only charge it when the battery % is around 20%.
