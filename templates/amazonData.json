For gaming, 3060ti 8GB is better, for rendering and graphics work this one is good enough. I feel the price is on the higher side considering current market prices. GDDR6 is quite fast and have paired it with 13700K which is being bottlenecked, better to go with intel 12/13 gen i5 600 series or Ryzen 5."}, {"user": "RAJU BABU SAKALI", "title": "GeForce RTX 3060", "star_rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "date": "Reviewed in India on 11 September 2022", "message": "Working fine..no problem arises in the installation let's see what it's working style.thanks"}, {"user": "Sanjay", "title": "Awesome speed.

Some fps like rainbow six seige and cs go get 300+ fps. Paired with i5 12600k and 32gb of ddr5 6000mhz. When the fans spin up they make a rattle/growl noise not unlike an ancient hard drive of the 90s era. With auto fan settings when there is a light load or on and off loads it can get pretty annoying since my case fans are basically silent. This can be made better by making fans be spun up/always on from boot with a fan profile. Not sure if this is because of the plastic housing around the fans but wish it didn't happen in the first place."}, {"user": "JuztPro", "title": "N/A", "star_rating": "N/A", "date": "Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 December 2022", "message": "It was a bit overpriced when I bought it maybe I could\u2019ve got a 3060 ti instead but it still runs smoothly on most games (fortnite,cod, god of war, minecraft, apex)I recommend using this with the Ryzen 5 or intel i5"}, {"user": "sean gallagher", "title": "N/A", "star_rating": "N/A", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on 9 October 2023", "message": "Using this card to video editing"}, {"user": "joshua w schoener", "title": "N/A", "star_rating": "N/A", "date": "Reviewed in the United States on 30 September 2023", "message": "This is a great mid level card.
